Sakamoto Kaori still wants "revenge" from last World Figure Skating Championships in Saitama
The reigning women's champion wants to settle a four-year-old score more than defend her title as the 2022-23 season winds down starting on Wednesday (22 March) in Japan.
Sakamoto Kaori has some unfinished business to take care of at this week’s ISU World Figure Skating Championships.
“I’m not that caught up on going back-to-back. What’s bigger to me is getting revenge from four years ago,” Sakamoto said on Monday (20 March) following her first practice at the Saitama Super Arena.
“I wouldn’t go as far as to say I’ve been pressing myself. But it’s made me a little bit tense the past week or so.”
Sakamoto would be referring to her world championships debut in 2019, also held in Saitama.
The then 19-year-old was in second after the short program but in the free, singled a triple flip that placed her fifth in the end. She missed the podium by less than a point.
It wasn't the ideal finish Sakamoto was expecting given all the work she had put in - especially in front of thousands of home fans in Saitama.
“Back then, I was only in my second season as a senior,” she recalled. “I’ve had a few years under my belt since then including an Olympic Games.
“I can lean on the experience to understand what to do when. I’d say that is the biggest difference compared to four years ago.
“I pushed and pushed myself like no other, trying to somehow squeeze every drop out of myself. In terms of preparation, I felt like I’d done everything I can for those world championships. I thought I was pretty solid technique, skill wise.
“I made so few mistakes in practise that when I made them in competition, it really hurt.”
Sakamoto heads into Wednesday’s short program as not only the defending champion but as an Olympic medallist (bronze) from Beijing 2022.
